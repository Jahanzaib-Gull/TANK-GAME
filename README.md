# Complete 2D Console Tank Game in C++!

Sharing my latest first semester console-based "Tank Mania" game project, built entirely in C++! This project was a deep dive into game mechanics, featuring strategic combat and dynamic enemy behaviors.

## Core Gameplay Features:

🎯 Objective: Navigate through mazes, eliminate all enemy tanks, and collect power-up pills to survive and score.
🏆 Win Condition: Defeat all three unique enemy tanks across multiple levels.
💀 Lose Condition: Player health reaches zero from enemy collisions or bullet hits.
⚡ Power-Ups: Collect '$' pills to boost player health and score.

## Advanced Technical Implementation:

### 👻 Smart Enemy AI:

Enemy 1 (Yellow): Patrols vertically.
Enemy 2 (White): Patrols horizontally.
Enemy 3 (Purple): Features unpredictable diagonal movement.
All enemies can fire bullets!

### 🕹️ Precise Controls:

Arrow Keys: For player movement (up, down, left, right) with accurate wall and obstacle collision.
SPACEBAR: To fire player bullets.

### 📊 Game State Management:

Real-time score tracking (points for pills and defeated enemies).
Player health counter with damage from enemy bullets and collisions.
Multiple levels with increasing difficulty and varied obstacle layouts.

## Development Insights:

### This project helped me master:

✔ Object collision and boundary checking for players, enemies, and bullets.
✔ Implementing diverse AI behaviors for different enemy types.
✔ Efficient game state and input management in a console environment.

### challenge

The biggest challenge was designing the multi-level system and balancing enemy fire rates and movements to create challenging yet fair gameplay. I'm particularly proud of the distinct personalities of each enemy tank!
